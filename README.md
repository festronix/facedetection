# facedetection

This project is all about face detection using MOBILENET model.

Here I have used 160 images for training the model and 40 for testing. 

   Basic things which we are using here are as follows :

□We are using RELU as and activation function here and RMSprop as an optimiser. 

□We are using different layers like sequential, Dense and flattening.

□We are using Maxpooling and ZeroPadding.

□We are using size 32 generally on the most tier systems we can use between 16 - 32.

□We are using learning rate as 0.001 it is better to use low learning rate to make your model accurate.
